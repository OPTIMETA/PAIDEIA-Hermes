description: Strategy-level blind drill on a known HW or example problem. User describes approach in prose (no math typing); Claude verifies against solution then saves clean reference to derivations/.
argument-hint: <problem-id, e.g. "hw4-p3" or "example-5.2">

## Output language

Read `INTERFACE_LANG` from `.course-meta` (default `en`). All user-facing prose — chat output, clarification questions, and narrative sections of any MD file you write — must be in that language. Keep in English regardless: file paths, slash command names, pattern IDs (P1, P2…), YAML keys (`pattern:`, `error_type:`, `problem_id:`, `source:`, `date:`, `summary:`), LaTeX, code, and the literal section anchors downstream tools regex on (`## One-line verdict`, `## Page N`, `# Vision-OCR transcription`).

Load `skills/exam-drill/SKILL.md`. Read `course-index/patterns.md`.

Target: the arguments provided above

Procedure:

1. **Load problem statement ONLY** from `converted/homework/<n>.md` or `converted/textbook/<ch>.md` (for textbook examples). Do NOT open the solution yet.

2. **Present the problem verbatim** to the user.

3. **Request strategy** (3–5 lines in $INTERFACE_LANG prose, no math typing). The 3 axes to ask about:
   ```
   Strategy only — no equations needed.
   1) Which pattern(s) will you use? (Pk number from course-index/patterns.md)
   2) Which variables held fixed; which expanded?
   3) What form do you expect the final answer to take?
   ```

   Render those three axes in $INTERFACE_LANG.

4. **Wait for response.** Do NOT proceed until the user answers.

5. **Load solution** from `converted/solutions/<n>.md` (or `converted/textbook/...` for example). Compare 3 axes:

   a. **Pattern identification** — correct Pk(s)?
   b. **Variable choice** — correct hold-fixed set?
   c. **End-form prediction** — matches actual answer structure?

6. **Feedback protocol:**
   - ✅ all three → confirm, then copy the relevant part of the solution into `derivations/blind-<id>.md` for permanent reference
   - ❌ on any axis → point out specifically which axis failed, WITHOUT revealing correct answer. Ask for revision.
   - After 2 failed attempts on same axis → give a one-line hint referencing the relevant pattern name.

7. **Log errors** if user needed revision. Use the **canonical schema from `skills/answer-processing/SKILL.md` Step 6** — same keys `/grade` writes, so statusline and weakmap see `/blind` errors too. Append to `errors/log.md`:
   ```yaml
   - problem_id: <id>
     pattern: <Pk>
     error_type: pattern-missed | wrong-variable | wrong-end-form
     summary: "<1 line>"
     source: blind/<id>
     date: <ISO>
   ```
   Map strategy axis → `error_type`: pattern axis → `pattern-missed`, variable axis → `wrong-variable`, end-form axis → `wrong-end-form`.

8. **Close** (in $INTERFACE_LANG):
   "To check retention on the same type, do one variant via `/twin <id>`."

## Why strategy-based, not full-derivation

Exam pattern recognition is the bottleneck — if the user can articulate the correct strategy in 30 seconds, they'll execute it in 10 minutes on the exam. The strategy check IS the drill. Execution is practiced via paper + `/grade`.
